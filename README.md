JMLCute Essentials
This project tests jmlcute in a developer-like directory structure.

Build
You need Vagrant or a 64-bit Linux system to run jmlcute.
If you have Vagrant, run 'vagrant up' to build the system.
Then, run 'vagrant ssh; cd /vagrant/' to change to the current synced directory, but within the virtual 64-bit Linux environment. Any changes to the virtual (guest) directory will be felt in the host.
If you run jmlcute-essentials in a 64-bit Linux system, jmlcute is already built.

Run
To run jmlcute in the project within src/main/java, run './debugJMLCute'.
